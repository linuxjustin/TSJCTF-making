## Description

Once upon a time there was a little girl whose mother was sick, and she was so poor that she had nothing else but the clothes she was wearing.

She was good and pious, however.

And as she was thus forsaken by all the world, she gambled her life, trusting in dear God.

...and her cryptography skills.

昔々あるところに、ひとりの貧しい少女がおりました。

病気の母親を助けるために、朝に夕に働きますが、お金は少ししか集まりません。

でも大丈夫、世の中には、親切な人が大勢いるのです。

そう、暗号学に詳しい親切な人が⋯⋯。
